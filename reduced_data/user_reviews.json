It has it's own separate check in area (open from 7 am - 9 pm) and a lounge where they serve breakfast, afternoon snacks, evening hors d'oeuvres and have an open bar from 5-8 pm.  The lounge has a wonderful view with huge windows that span the length of the lounge looking out towards the strip and TI and MIrage. It's decorated in a classy and comfortable manner and there's even a baby grand piano that plays itself situated in the middle of the main lounge area.  The suites you stay in are the same as the regular Palazzo suites, so that means they're still spacious (about 720 sq ft) and beautifully decorated.  You basically pay for the extra amenities and to use the lounge. So, you can pay for the Prestige suite ahead of time or if  you have a Palazzo or Venetian reservation already, you can upgrade to Prestige for an extra $100+tax per night for 2 people.\n\nAlthough I'm a local, I've actually staycationed here a couple times and recommend staying here to friends coming into town who have the finances to do so.\n\nAs far as the staff, the Prestige Agents are really helpful and personable.  They really take their time checking you in and talking to you.  They are actually all concierge agents and can help you book shows, tours, dinner reservation either at the Venetian and Palazzo or somewhere else.  And because it's a private lounge, they usually remember your name and make you feel like you're not just another guest staying at another strip hotel.  If you're a tourist and don't really have your Vegas trip planned, this is a great way to find options and get personalized recommendations.\n\nThe food is pretty good too.  The breakfast presentation isn't too extraordinary, but some of the hors d'oeuvres in the evening are really good.  On the weekends, the have casino restaurants (like Valentino) cater part of the dinner presentation.  It's a great way to try some higher end restaurant food without having to pay extra!\n\nHonestly though, what I really like is the open bar.  If you come here with a group of friends, bachelor party, bachelorette party, date, family, or whomever, the open bar serves you from 5 pm - 8 pm and it's a full bar. \n\nIt's really a great experience with really friendly staff (the servers in the lounge are really attentive and friendly and clear your plates and grab drinks in a really timely manner).  Depending on how often you actually utilize the lounge (and I definitely do for the drinks!), the upgrade charge pays for itself.

My OCDness likes that they organize their buffet trays from starters to sides to entrees.  They used to have a dessert warmer at the very end, but I think they nixed this because not enough people were utilizing it during the lunch hours.\n\nMy favorites are (and I will definitely butcher the correct names of these items): the yellow Indian fried rice with vegetables, fried vegetables, the noodles with vegetables, chicken tikka masala (I know that one!), goat curry, and spicy chili chicken.  I'm pretty sure I've tried everything there, but these are my go to dishes.\n\nThe 5 stars comes from food and price alone.  They really do have delicious high quality food.

Both sides we had, button mushrooms and the garlic mash, were great and completed the meal.\n\nFor dessert, we split their homemade donuts.

I was so excited to be there.\n\nThe service was absolutely subpar.  Our server (I never got her name because she never introduced herself to us) was very impersonal.  Neither of us once got the feeling we were welcomed there or that our patronage was appreciated.  \n\nAfter reading rave reviews about the baked lobster bisque topped with a puff pastry, I was so excited to try it.  I was told there would be a 15 minute wait for it, but good things come to those who wait, right?

So, for over 15 minutes we waited with no water to drink while there was only one other couple in the restaurant.  I overheard the other couple trying to order an alcoholic beverage.  The server seemed perplexed as to their own drink menu and the gentleman had to point out on the drink menu what he wanted to order.\n\nWhen our food finally arrived, I still had high hopes.  Here was an opportunity for recovery.  Unfortunately, everything fell flat.  The puff pasty is messy when you break it into the soup.  The flakes kind of fall everywhere.  This wouldn't be a problem, but the soup is served in a little bowl on a little saucer, so pastry flakes went all over the table.  Even my friend's plate seemed too small for his dish and rice (even though he ordered fries) fell on the table.  And I swear neither of us are messy eaters.  \n\nWe brought to their attention the error in my friend's order and that was remedied, but it felt like we bothered them to get the side we had ordered in the first place. \n\nThe lobster bisque was just disappointing.  When I think of lobster bisque, I think of creamy, orangey soup with thick chunks of delicious lobster in it.  This bisque was liquidy, greyish orange (there were visible oil beads separated from the rest of the base floating on the surface) with 3 small pieces of lobster in it.  I couldn't bring myself to eat the whole thing.\n\nThe steak pyramid was just okay.  There were only 3 small pieces of actual steak in the tall pyramid that we determined was primarily made of onion rings. My friend asked for it medium rare.  It was definitely medium well. It looked nothing like the other Yelp pictures. Another disappointment.\n\nWe were both obviously done dinning for awhile and sat in sheer disappointment as we waited over 10 minutes for our bill.  I still have no idea what our server was doing because as I stated, there were only 2 couples in the restaurant.\n\nAs a small business, it is imperative to be proactive in customer satisfaction. I know the owners actually read these reviews as I see recovery responses to the negative reviews on here.  But if your employees actually paid attention to your customers while they were at the restaurant, it would never get to this point.\n\nThe service absolutely needs refinement.  I am not expecting to be catered to, but I expect to be treated with respect and as though I am appreciated as a customer.  Never once did our server \"talk\" to us or even ask how we were doing.

I already knew...it was the FAIL installation from the neighbor \"contractor\".\n\nHe IMMEDIATELY identified multiple issues with the installation and had good ideas on why the pilot wasn't working.  He retreated to his van and put together an estimate.  He came back ~30 minutes later with a bill for $90 for the initial troubleshooting call and an estimate of $195 to fix the craptastic installation my neighbor \"contractor\" did.  I pulled the trigger on the work and said let's do it now.  He came back in one hour with everything he needed to make sure I didn't blow up in a few weeks from the original shoddy work of the neighbor \"contractor\".\n\nI'm guessing he was down there for 1.5 hours total for all this.  He squared off all the iron pipe connections, leveled the iron pipe so it didn't look like it was installed by a drunk, installed a regulator, fixed the useless debris trap that the neighbor \"contractor\" installed (didn't meet code), removed the flex appliance tube that went from the basement to the first floor (didn't meet code), installed iron pipe through the floor, installed a valve under the heater unit (to meet code), secured the hanging pipe (to meet code), hooked up the flex pipe to the heater and then checked for leaks.  Wouldn't you know it....the damn heater fired right up on the first try.  Amazing.  Glad I didn't listen to the neighbor \"contractor\" and send it back because a new heater would still not have worked.\n\nI guess everything in life is a learning experience and wisdom is gained only after successful application of prior learning experience results.  I learned that things like this should be done by the professionals the first time.  Trying to save a buck by getting your neighbor to do it will end in failure 99% of the time and quite possibly endanger yourself and others.\n\nI also inquired about how much this would have cost if I got them to do the original install.  He said \"about $350\".  If you subtract the $70 in parts that I bought for the neighbor \"contractor\" to install it, their labor rate would have been $280.  Neighbor \"contractor\" wanted $560 for labor but I gave him $200 cash since it took him 2.5 hours to install.  That's $80/hr for un-certified handyman to perform an unsafe heater install that doesn't meet code and will cost me even more when I try to sell this place.  If I paid him $560 it would have been $224/hr. for an unskilled \"contractor\" to almost kill you and your tenant.  Two lessons learned.  #1 is that neighbor \"contractor\" is an underhanded scoundrel.  #2 is that you should call the professionals if you might be killed by a heater.\n\nThe HVAC tech that fixed everything was all of the following:\n\n1 - Punctual\n2 - Professional\n3 - Clean (he wore little booty covers when on carpet)\n4 - Not full of BS\n5 - Detail-oriented\n6 - Empathic (which is hard when he knows you're shelling out more money to fix somebody else's jacked up installation)\n7 - EXPERIENCED (27 years as HVAC tech).\n\nIn closing, Matt Mertz Plumbing thoroughly impressed me today and they will get my future business.  I should have called them in the first place...I recommend you do the same the first time around and avoid being incinerated at the hands of an uneducated, unskilled neighbor \"contractor\" ripoff artist.", "useful": 5, "funny": 1, "cool": 0}, {"review_id": "_e4gn2ooSlSHIFwirR7kWQ", "user_id": "FIt6aTdK_iWsxoBqGVHaFg", "business_id": "ZARPISrzPW6PrMSwexHnxw", "stars": 4.0, "date": "2017-02-19", "text": "My fiancee had a Burnt Almond Torte $9 and I had the Choco Taco shake $9.

It was greasy and not much cheese but we could stomach it.  Definitely NOT worth $14 for the portion or the quality.  3/5 stars\n\nShrimp Scampi - This was without a doubt the worst item we ordered.  The pasta appeared to be reheated and gooey.  It was stuck together in one large clump that we could not separate.  We had to use a knife and fork to \"slice\" it apart.  It was bland and disgusting.  I think there were (6) 16 count tail on shrimp with no seasoning.  They were cooked (Thank the baby Jesus that they got that right) but there was hardly any butter/garlic sauce to be found.  Also NOT worth $17.  1/5 stars\n\nApple and Bleu Flatbread - My fiancee wanted to try this and said it was OK.  The apples were raw and didn't go well with the rest but unlike the rest of our order it was fairly edible.  3/5 stars\n\nMeatballs - We got two of these to split.  They were dried out balls of meat that seemed to be reheated.  I ate an entire one and regretted it immediately afterwards.  The fiancee threw hers out because it was also nasty.  1/5 stars\n\nBruschetta - This was tasty but the driver must have rolled his car down a hill on the way here.  The bruschetta was tossed in with the bread so everything was jumbled and mixed together.  I'm sure this would be better in person without Evil Knieval delivering it.  3/5 stars\n\nBaklava Cheesecake - Fiancee said this was tasty.  Not the best she had but also nothing like the other menu items.  We are guessing the desserts are made somewhere else or come frozen. 4/5 stars\n\nMocha Pie - I had a few bites of this and it was OK.  3/5 stars\n\nMy total bill was $80 for this horrible food.

I did not try them.  I had the Heron Point Crab Toast.  It was reasonably sized and full of flavor.  I recommend it.\n\nFor a main course she had the Hokkaido Scallops.  She said they were great but as a man I would have wanted a larger portion.  She said the noodles under the 4 scallops were just average.  I had the filet with gorgonzola, buttered green beans and carrots with truffle potato gratin.  The filet was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  I would have liked the gorgonzola melted slightly more but it was still great.  The vegetables were also a delicious side with the butter they used.  The potato gratin however was lacking.  There was very little truffle or raclette flavor.  This was a disappointment since I was looking forward to this dish.\n\nFor dessert she had the PBC.

I believe they make them by the pan and keep them in an oven, sometimes mixing the old pan with the new.

I walked by the restaurant and saw a guy eating ramen noodles and for some strange reason, I wanted to eat some ramen noodles too lol.  The reason why I thought it was strange and why it took so long for me to try Noodlecat was because of it being ramen noodles. I find it the meal to eat when I'm broke, there were times when I ate it so much I thought I would never in my life eat it again. Well Friday night I wanted some, along with trying out a steamed bun (or two).  \n\nI know this will come off as silly but I wasn't too happy with the bar stools at the table. I like backs to my chairs lol, somewhere I can hang my purse. I didn't realize the only area that had backs to the chairs was the bar area but it was too late because I already settled in (ugh what is wrong with me lol). On the table there is a clipboard with copies of the menu and the server was giving walking me through on how to order, which in my opinion was pretty self explanatory. Made my choices and was anxious to dig in. The service was okay, I ordered a drink but my server forgot to look at my entire menu selection (which also carryover to the back) and he really didn't check on me at all...didn't get the \"your meal will be ready in a few moments\" or something along those lines. At one point as I was looking down eating the mushy, tasteless ramen and a guy came out of nowhere and grabbed the two empty bowls and just kept walking. It did startled me a bit, looking up asking myself \"does he work here?\"\n\nAs I stated above, the ramen was very mushy and tasteless...didn't enjoy it at all.  When I am in the mood for at home ramen, I do like it to be a little bit firm. I was making myself eat the rest because I didn't want to be hungry later in the day. I also ordered two steamed buns...the pork and the fried chicken, now those were good, especially the chicken.  It does get a little messy but the sauce was yummy delicious so it was worth it. I kind of wished I should've swapped the bowl of coconut ramen for two (or three) more steamed buns. \n\nThis actually would have gotten less stars if it wasn't for the steamed buns, which would be the reason for a return visit.
